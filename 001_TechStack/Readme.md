# C Programming

The best way to learn C is by writing programs.  Thus, the goal of the first program is to make sure there is an environment that will successfully compile, load, and run a C program.  Additionally, once the program is run the output must be found. <br /><br />

There are many different environments capable of successfully writing, compiling, running, and producing an output using the C programming language. <br /><br />

Once your environment is setup, run this simple helloworld program.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  printf("Hello, World!!!\n");
  return 0;
}
```
